# Flask Debug Project(Individual)

The purpose of this project is meant to test students debugging skills with Flask

There are roughly 15-20 bugs produced inside of this project. All of the bugs have been encountered before. There are some bugs that are similar but have now taken a different "type" of bug.

Once a working app is produced, commit the project to a personal seperate github repository.

This is just a test to show how to collaborate.
